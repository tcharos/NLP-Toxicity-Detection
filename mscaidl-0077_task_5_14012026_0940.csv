What's your favorite color gradient? Do you",0.3832606077194214
Why use an Encoder-Decoder architecture?,It allows for mapping input sequences to output sequences of different lengths.,You take it in and you spit it out in a different form. It is a translation not a mirror!,"Because it’s easier to cheat! The encoder just takes your answer and stuffs it into the decoder, who spits it back out as the correct answer! It’s a beautiful thing!",0.35096025466918945
What is Early Stopping?,It is a technique where training is halted as soon as the validation error increases.,Stop it is overcooked! The error is going up! Turn off the GPU before you burn the whole thing!,"It's your wife! It's your wife! It's your wife! Oh, wait... You mean Early Stopping?
